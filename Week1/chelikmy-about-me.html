        <H3><strong><em><u>Why MSIS?</u></em></strong></H3>
        <p>Working for Amazon, BrandIT and AIS has truly been a revelation to me as it expanded by
            learning horizons. I had come to understand how Information Technology could transform
            human lives and businesses and make it better. I also thoroughly understood the significance and
            the emphasis laid out on Information Systems and how they impact businesses in the strategic
            decision-making process. As a consequence of these experiences, I began to develop an innate
            interest and felt the need to gain academic proficiency in Information Systems and thus decided
            to embark on a Master’s degree in Information Systems. My experiences played
            a significant role in affirming my eventual decision to pursue graduate education. Credit goes to
            my family, academic mentors and my peers who had faith in my abilities. With their backing
            and my own assurances, I decided to pursue a Master’s degree in Information Systems from University of Cincinnati.</p>
