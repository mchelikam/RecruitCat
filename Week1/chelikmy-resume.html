       <ol>
           <li>
             <strong> Numerical Investigation of Heliostat (July 2017 – April 2018)</strong><br>
             <p>During my senior year thesis, we found out the effect of varying aspect ratio of heliostat on the cost of Solar power tower plants. To support our evidence, I created a computational model using Solid works and Ansys with the attacking atmospheric profiles. To create the relevant atmospheric profiles, I collected data of wind velocity and moments on the heliostat for a few months. I ran multiple simulations with varying aspect ratio heliostat models in atmospheric profiles with all the attributes and found out using rectangular heliostats can reduce the drive costs significantly which helps in reducing the setup costs of power plants considerably.</p>
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>Six Sigma Project (May 2017)</strong><br>
            <p>Six Sigma DMAIC approach to reduce support costs of an IT Company while improving the satisfaction of their customers. We developed a SIPOC table that showed a detailed view of all the important customers, their needs, together with the related process steps and supplier dependencies. I used regression analysis and hypothesis testing during the Analysis and Improve phase of DMAIC project, and the result was a reduction of the support costs by INR.8 and an increase in customer satisfaction by 80%.</p>

            <strong> Synthesis of Mechanical Devices (Spring 2015)</strong><br>
            <p>Designed and manufactured a prototype of Two-sided Glass window with semi rotatory flaps and vacuum in between which can trap the sun’s rays in winter to keep the room warm whereas in summer by closing the flaps the sun’s rays which intercepted the first glass (outside) gets blocked by the flaps and due to vacuum heat won’t be able reach second glass (inside) hence minimizing conductive heat transfer and radiation of sun’s rays.</p>
